WHAT IS MICROMEGA
-----------------

The name Micromega is a tribute to omega -- the existing Coq decision procedure for linear integer arithmetics. 
The proving power of the micromega tactics is not comparable with Omega.
It solves a superset (Mega) of a subset (Micro) of the goals omega can cope with.


Micromega is a Coq reflexive tactic for a fragment of integer arithmetics.  
It is using a "positivity theorem" (Positivstellensatz) to find witnesses of unfeasibility of 
a set of polynomial constraints. In short, this Positivstellensatz established by Stengle in 1974
generalises both  Farkas's Lemma and Hilbert's Nullstellensatz.
(For more insights about the theory, look at the paper  
"Fast Reflexive Arithmetic Tactics: the linear case and beyond" to appear in TYPES'06).



Compared to the (R)omega procedure, micromega is less complete:
1 - Farkas's lemma is only complete over the rational - not for the integers
  For instance, it cannot be used to prove the following goal : forall (x:Z), 2*x = 1 -> False
2 - while (R)omega deals with propositional operators  /\ \/ ~ , micromega simply ignores them

However, when micromega succeeds, the proof term produced by micromega should be smaller and faster to check.
Moreover, micromega can solve certain non-linear goals -- still experimental...


WHEN TO USE MICROMEGA
---------------------

Concretely, micromega  solves goals of the form
H1 : expr1 op1 expr1'
....
Hn : exprn opn exprn'
-----------------------------
False

where opi ranges over {>,<,>=,<=,=}
and expr are  expressions defined over Z using addition and multiplication

Micromega can also solve goals for which the conclusion is made of a conjunction of  constraints
expr1 op1 expr1' /\ ..... /\ exprn op1 exprn'

BUILD
-----
In file Makefile, set the COQTOP variable to the root directory of your coq source distribution.
make

This generates customized coq runtimes using the coqmktop utility : micromega micromega.opt

USAGE
-----
micromega.opt -I <directory_of_omicron>

1 - Load the micromega tactics : "Require Import Micromegatac."
2 - Kill a goal : "micronega."

Look at the test.v file for tiny examples.


EXPERIMENTAL 
------------
If micronega fails to find a witness, you can provide micronega with a list of 'polynomial hints'.
micronega p1 ... pn
These polynomial will be squared and  the inequalities p_1^2 >= 0 ... p_n^2 will be added to the
hypotheses to direct the proof search.
